    Critic.</i>)</h4>

    <p>I had been told that Ostend was an excellent place. "Quite a
    Town of Palaces!" was the enthusiastic description that had
    reached me. So I determined to leave "Delicious Dover" (as the
    holiday Leader-writer in the daily papers would call it), and
    take boat for the Belgian coast. The sea was as calm as a lake,
    and the sun lazily touched up the noses of those who slumbered
    on the beach. There is an excellent service of steamers between
    England and Belgium. This service has but one drawback&mdash;a
    slight one: the vessels have a way with them of perpetrating
    practical jokes. Only a week or so ago one lively mail-carrier
    started prematurely, smashing a gangway, and dropping a
    portmanteau quietly into the ocean. On my return from foreign
    shores, I passed the same cheerful ship lying in mid-channel as
    helpless as an infant. However, the accident (something, I
    fancy, had gone wrong with the engines) appeared to be treated
    as more amusing than important. Still, perhaps, it would be
    better were the name of this luckless boat changed to <i>Le
    Farceur</i>; then travellers would know what to expect. But I
    must confess that my experiences were perfectly pleasant. The
    steamer in which I journeyed crossed the Channel in the
    advertised time, and if I wished to be hypercritical, I would
    merely hint that the official tariff of the refreshments sold
    on board is tantalising. When I wanted cutlets, I was told they
    were "off," and when I asked for "cold rosbif," that was "off"
    too. The <i>gar&ccedil;on</i> (who looked more like a
    midshipman than a cabin-boy) took ten minutes to discover this
    fact. And as I had to rely upon him for information, I had to
    wait even longer before the desired (or rather undesired)
    intelligence was conveyed to me. I pride myself upon caring
    nothing about food, but this failure to obtain my heart's (or
    thereabouts') yearning caused me sore annoyance.</p>

    <p>Well, I reached Ostend. The town of palaces contained a
    Kursaal and a Casino. There were also a number of large hotels
    of the King's Road, Brighton, <i>plus</i> Northumberland Avenue
    type. Further, there were several <i>maisons
    meubl&eacute;es</i> let out in flats, and (to judge from the
    prices demanded and obtained for them) <i>to</i> flats. The
    <i>suite</i> of apartments on the ground floor consisted of a
    small bed-room, a tiny drawing-room, and a balcony. The balcony
    was used, as a <i>salle &agrave; manger</i> in fine weather,
    and a place for the utterance of strong expressions (so I was
    informed) when the rain interfered with <i>al fresco</i>
    comfort. There was a steam tramway, and some bathing-machines
    of the springless throw-you-down-when-you-least-expect-it sort.
    The streets, omitting the walk in front of the sea, were
    narrow, and the shops about as interesting as those at the
    poorer end of the Tottenham Court Road. But these were merely
    details, the pride of Ostend being the Kursaal, which reminded
    me of an engine-house near a London terminus. I purchased a
    ticket for the Kursaal and the Casino. There was to be a
    concert at the first and a ball at the last. I soon had enough
    of the concert, and started for the ball.</p>

    <p>It was then that I found a regulation in force that made my
    cheeks tingle with indignation as an Englishman. Although the
    tickets costing three francs a piece, were said to secure
    admittance to the Kursaal and the Casino, I noticed that
    children&mdash;good and amiable children&mdash;were not allowed
    to enter the latter place. I could understand the feelings of a
    gentleman who attempted to obtain access for his eldest
    lad&mdash;a gallant boy of some fourteen summers, and a baker's
    dozen of winters. My heart went out to that British Father as
    he disputed with the Commissaires at the doorway, and called
    the attention of the Representative of "the Control" to the
    fact that his <i>billet</i> was misleading. "You are an
    Englishman," said the Representative of the Control, "and the
    English observe the law." "Yes," returned the angry Father;
    "but in England the Law would support one in obtaining that for
    which one had paid. My son has paid for admission to the
    Kursaal and the Casino! He is refused admittance to the Casino,
    therefore this ticket of his spreads false intelligence! It is
    a liar! It is a miserable! It should be called the traitor
    ticket!" But all was useless. The gallant lad had to remain
    with the umbrellas! I could not help sympathising with that
    father. I could not refrain from agreeing with him, that where
    such a thing was possible, something must be entirely wrong. I
    could not deny that under the circumstances Ostend was a sham,
    a delusion, and a snare! When he observed that Ostend was
    grotesquely expensive, I admitted that he was right. When he
    said that it was not a patch upon Boulogne or Dieppe, I again
    acquiesced. When he asserted that every English tourist would
    be wise to avoid the place, I acknowledged that there was the
    genuine ring of truth in his declaration. When he appealed to
    me, as a dispassionate observer, to say whether I did not
    consider the conduct of the authorities arbitrary, unjust, and
    absurd, I was forced to admit that I <i>did</i> consider that
    conduct absolutely indefensible. Lastly, when he announced that
    he intended never to say another word in praise of Ostend, I
    confessed that I had come in my own mind to the same
    determination.</p>

    <p>P.S.&mdash;I may add that I was accompanied by my son, who
    was also refused admittance. But this is a matter of purely
    personal interest, and has nothing whatever to do with it.</p>

    <h2>THE CACHET OF CASH AT DRURY LANE.</h2>

        <a href="images/133-2.png"><img width="100%"

             alt="Medal inscribed 'A Million of Money.'" />
             </a>Medal found in the Neighbourhood of Drury Lane.
    </div>

    <p><i>A Million of Money</i>, "a new military, sporting, and
    spectacular Drama," is a marvel of stage management. No better
    things than the <i>tableaux</i> of the Derby Day, the grounds
    of the Welcome Club, and the departure of the Guards from
    Wellington Barracks for foreign parts have been seen for many a
    long year. In such a piece the dialogue is a matter of
    secondary consideration, and even the story is of no great
    importance. That the plot should remind one of Drury Lane
    successes in the past is not surprising, considering that one
    of the authors (who modestly places his name second on the
    programme, when everyone feels that it should come first) has
    been invariably associated with those triumphs of scenic art.
    AUGUSTUS DRURIOLANUS has beaten his own record, and the
    <i>Million of Money</i> so lavishly displayed behind the
    scenes, is likely to be rivaled by the takings in front of the
    Curtain&mdash;or to be more exact, at the Box-office. The
    Authors, in more senses than one, have carried money into the
    house. But they have done more&mdash;they have inculcated a
    healthy moral. While Mr. HENRY ARTHUR JONES is teaching
    audiences a lessen in <i>Judah</i>, that would have received
    the enthusiastic approval of the philanthropic Earl of
    SHAFTESBURY, after whom Shaftesbury Theatre is, no doubt,
    called, the great HARRIS and the lesser PETTIT are showing us
    in the character of the <i>Rev. Gabriel Maythorne</i>, a Parson
    that would as certainly have secured the like hearty good-will
    at the same shadowy hands. The Rev. Gentleman is a clergyman
    that extorts the admiration of everyone whose good opinion is
    worth securing. He apparently is a "coach," and (seemingly)
    allows his pupils so much latitude that one of them, <i>Harry
    Dunstable</i> (Mr. WARNER), is able to run up to town with his
    (the Reverend's) daughter secretly, marry her, and stay in
    London for an indefinite period. And he (the Parson) has no
    absurd prejudices&mdash;no narrow-mindedness. He goes to the
    Derby, where he appears to be extremely popular at
    luncheon-time amongst the fair ladies who patronise the tops of
    the drags, and later on becomes quite at home at an illuminated
    <i>f&ecirc;te</i> at the Exhibition, amidst the moonlight, and
    a thousand additional lamps. It is felt that the Derby is run
    with this good man's blessing; and everyone is glad, for,
    without it, in spite of the horses, jockeys, carriages,
    acrobats, gipsies, niggers, grooms, stable-helps, and
    pleasure-seekers, the <i>tableau</i> would be
    &aelig;sthetically incomplete. And the daughter of the Reverend
    is quite as interesting as her large-hearted sire. She, too,
    has no prejudices (as instance, the little matrimonial trip to
    London); and when she has to part with her husband, on his
    departure (presumably <i>en route</i> to the Bermudas), she
    requires the vigorous assistance' of a large detachment of Her
    Majesty's Guards to support her in her bereavement. Of the
    actors, Mr. CHARLES GLENNEY, as a broken-down gentleman, is
    certainly the hero of the three hours and a half. In Act III.,
    on the night of the first performance, he brought down the
    house, and received two calls before the footlights after the
    Curtain had descended. He has many worthy colleagues, for
    instance, Mr. HARRY NICHOLLS, Miss MILLWARD, Mr. CHARLES
    WARNER, and Miss FANNY BROUGH, are all that could be desired in
    their respective lines. But, well cast as it undoubtedly is,
    the play has vitality within it that does not depend for
    existence upon the efforts of the company. It is good all
    round&mdash;scenery, dresses, properties, and effects&mdash;and
    will keep its place at Drury Lane until dislodged by the
    Pantomime at Christmas.</p>

    </div>

    <p>STOCKHOLM approached by lovely river (that is, we approached
    Stockholm by lovely river), with banks and hills covered with
    pine and birch trees, and studded with villas, where the
    Stockholm people live away from the town. "Studded" is a good
    word, but phrase sounds too much like "studied with SASS," as
    so many of our best artists did. Lovely for boating. Why don't
    the Swedes row? <i>They don't.</i> Lots of islands, and
    everybody as jolly as sand-boys, especially on Sanday. By the
    way, what's a "sand-boy"? Why <i>toujours</i> jolly?</p>

    <p>Stockholm a stunning place, all built round a huge palace,
    copy of the Pitti Palace in Florence. Lifts to take the people
    up-hill, and a circular tramway all round the town for one
    penny. Lots of soldiers in uniforms like Prussians or Russians,
    whichever you like. Such swagger policemen, all tall and
    handsome, with beautiful helmets and lovely coats. What would
    an English cook say to them?</p>

    <p>Cathedral with tombs of GUSTAVUS VASA, GUSTAVUS ADOLPHUS,
    and BERNADOTTE. What was BERNADOTTE doing here? Didn't like to
    ask. Piled up with kettledrums and flags taken from the
    Russians. I noticed in Russia their churches were equally piled
    up with drums and flags taken from the Swedes. Exchange is no
    robbery.</p>

    <p>Lunch. First view of the Swedish snacks before lunch and

    sausages, brown bread, prawns, kippered herrings, radishes,
    sardines, crawfish, cheeses. Should spell it "Lax and Snax."
    Three silver tubs of spirit&mdash;Pommerans, Renadt, and
    Kummin&mdash;tried 'em all. All good. "We had a good

    <p>Swedes have a poet, BELLMAN, evidently who wrote
    Bacchanalian songs. They have a national holiday on July the
    26th, and go to <i>F&ecirc;te</i> in a Wood, where bronze head
    of BELLMAN is, cover it with garlands and roses, and sing and
    have a good time before it, just like an old Greek offering to
    Bacchus. I saw it. And in the evening a <i>f&ecirc;te</i> where
    they carry a child got up as Bacchus, and seated on a barrel
    with a wine-cup. A regular jolly drinking procession. They have
    a wonderful open air <i>restaurant</i> called The Hasselbacken,
    where you dine in delightful little green arbours, and lots of
    Swedish girls about. Capital dinners, A 1 wine, and first-rate
    music with full band. No charge to go in; you pay before
    leaving, though. Very good waiting.</p>

    <p>The Swedes are very polite, and take their hats off on the
    slightest provocation, and keep them off a long time, specially
    whilst talking to a lady. When talking to <i>two</i> ladies, of
    course they keep 'em off double the time.</p>

    <p>Altogether a delightful place. But they all say you should
    come in the <i>winter</i>. Wish I could. FLOTSAM, Y.A.</p>

    <p>P.S.&mdash;The Swedish girls are as a rule very handsome.
    Tall, with long legs. Men good-looking also.</p>

    <p>I can't very well do myself; I can "do myself" remarkably

    <h2>"WANTED!"</h2>

    <p>WANTED, by a well-travelled lady, of &aelig;sthetic and
    refined tastes, a comfortable and congenial home with a
    Duchess. The Advertiser, who is a person of much intelligence,
    and a most agreeable gossip, regards her pleasant companionship
    as an equivalent for the social advantages (including
    carriage-drives, and an introduction to the very best society),
    for which she is prepared to offer the very handsome
    remuneration of ten shillings a week.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>HORSE WANTED.&mdash;Must have been placed in a recent Derby,
    and show a good racing record. Thoroughly sound in wind and
    limb, expected to be equal to carrying 13 stone in the Park, or
    to doing any work from a four-in-hand down to single harness in
    a hearse. On the advertiser being furnished with a suitable
    beast, he will be prepared to put down a five-pound note for
    him, payable by ten-shilling monthly instalments.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>HOME REQUIRED FOR AN INDIAN CHIEF.&mdash;The Advertiser, who
    has recently received a consignment of Savages from Patagonia,
    and has had to entertain their Monarch in his residence at
    Bayswater, as he is about to pay a four weeks' visit to the
    Continent, is anxious in the meantime to find a suitable home
    for him in some quiet suburban family, who would not object to
    some fresh and lively experience introduced into the routine of
    their domestic circle, in consideration for a small payment to
    defray the slight extra cost involved in his support. He will
    give little trouble, an empty attic furnished with a hearth-rug
    supplying him with all the accommodation he will require, while
    his food has hitherto consisted of tripe, shovelled to him on a
    pitchfork, and stout mixed with inferior rum, of which he gets
    through about a horse-pailful a day. His chief recreation being
    a "Demon's War Dance," in which he will, if one be handy, hack
    a clothes-horse to pieces with his "baloo," or two-edged
    chopper-axe, he might be found an agreeable inmate by an aged
    and invalid couple, who would relish a little unusual
    after-dinner excitement, as a means of passing away a quiet
    evening or two. Applicants anxious to secure the Chief should
    write at once. Three-and-sixpence a-week will be paid for his
    keep, which, supplying the place of the rum in his drink (which
    has been tried with effect) with methylated spirit mixed with
    treacle, affords an ample margin for a handsome profit on the
    undertaking.</p>

    <h2>TIPS FROM THE TAPE.</h2>

    <h4>(<i>Picked up in Mr. Punch's own Special City
    Corner.</i>)</h4>

    <p>In my last I announced that I was busily giving my mind to
    the launching of a new "Combination Pool" over the satisfactory
    results of which to all concerned in it, under certain
    contingencies, I had no shadow of a doubt. This I have since
    managed to float on the market, and, though I worked it on a
    principle of my own, which, for want of a better description, I
    have styled amalgamated "Profit and Loss," I regret to have to
    inform those clients who have entrusted me with their cheques
    in the hopes of getting, <i>as I really fully believed they
    would</i>, 700 per cent. for their money in three days, that I
    have had to close the speculation rather suddenly, and I fear,
    as the following illustrative figures will show in a fashion
    that not only deprives me of the pleasure of enclosing them a
    cheque for Profits, but obliges me to announce to them that
    their cover has disappeared. The Stocks with which I operated
    were "Drachenfonteim Catapults," "Catawanga Thirty-fives," and
    "Blinker's Submarine Explosives." The ILLUSTRATION, I hoped,
    <i>would have stood as follows</i>:&mdash;</p>

    <p>This, I need scarcely say, has at present not only eaten up
    every halfpenny of cover, but a great deal besides; and I am
    not sure that I shall not have to come down on my clients to
    make good the balance. I cannot account for the result, except
    from the fact that a new clerk read out the wrong tape; and
    when I telephoned to my West-End Private Inquiry Agent about
    these very three Stocks, he appears not to have heard me
    distinctly, and thought I was asking him about Goschens, the
    old Three-per-Cents., and Bank Stock, about which, of course,
    he could only report favourably. It is an awkward mistake, but,
    as I point out to all my clients, one must not regard the
    Dealer as infallible. These things will occur. However, I am
    going to be more careful in future; and I may as well announce
    now, that on Monday next I am about to open a new Syndicate
    Combination Pool, with a Stock about which I have made the most
    thorough and exhaustive inquiries, with the result that I am
    convinced an enormous fortune will be at the command of anyone
    who will entrust me with a sufficiently large cheque in the
    shape of cover to enable me to realise it.</p>

    <p>For obvious reasons I keep the name of this Stock at present
    a dead secret. Suffice it to say, that the operation in
    question is connected with an old South-American Gold Mine,
    about to be reworked under the auspices of a new company who
    have bought it for a mere song. When I tell my clients that I
    have got all my information from the Chairman, <i>who took down
    under his greatcoat a carpet-bag full of crushed quartz
    carefully mixed with five ounces of gold nuggets</i>, and
    emptied this out at the bottom of a disused shaft, and then got
    a Yankee engineer to report the discovery of ore in "lumps as
    big as your fist," and state this in the new prospectus, they
    will at once see what a solid foundation I have for this new
    venture, which must inevitably fly upwards by leaps and bounds
    as soon as the shares are placed upon the market. Of course,
    when the truth comes out, there will be a reaction, but my
    clients may trust me to be on the look-out for that, and, after
    floating with all their investments to the top of the tide, to
    get out of the concern with enormous profits before the bubble
    eventually bursts. It is by a command of information of this
    kind that I hope to ensure the confidence and merit the support
    of my friends and patrons. Remember Monday next, and bear in
    mind a cheque for three-and-sixpence covers &pound;5000. The
    subjoined is from my correspondence:&mdash;</p>

    <p>Sir,&mdash;I have as trustee for five orphan nieces to
    invest for each of them &pound;3 18<i>s.</i> 9<i>d.</i>, left
    them by a deceased maternal cousin. How ought I to invest this
    to the greatest advantage with a due regard to security. What
    do you say to Goschens? Or would you recommend Rio Diavolos
    Galvanics? These promise a dividend of 70 per cent., and
    although they have not paid one for some time, are a
    particularly cheap stock at the present market price, the scrip
    of the Five per Cent. Debenture Stock being purchased by a
    local butterman at seven pounds for a halfpenny. A Spanish
    Nobleman who holds some of this, will let me have it even
    cheaper. What would you advise me to do? Yours, &amp;c. A
    TRUSTEE IN A FOG.</p>

    <p>Don't touch Goschens, they are not a speculative Stock. You
    certainly might do worse than the Rio Diavolos Galvanics. Do
    not hesitate, but put the little all of your five orphan nieces
    into them at once, and <i>wait for the rise</i>.</p>

    <p>A BUBBLE FROM THE SUDS.&mdash;A Firm of Soap-boilers have
    been sending round a circular to "Dramatic Authors" of
    established reputation, and (no doubt) others, offering to
    produce gratis the best piece submitted to them at a
    "<i>Matin&eacute;e</i> performance at a West End Theatre." The
    only formality necessary to obtain this sweet boon is the
    purchase of a box of the Firm's soap, which will further
    contain a coupon "entitling the owner to send in one new and
    original play for reading." The idea that a Dramatic Author of
    any standing would submit his work to such a tribunal, even
    with the dazzling prospect of a <i>Matin&eacute;e in
    futuro</i>, is too refreshing! However, as literary men
    nowadays fully appreciate the value of their labour, the idea,
    in spite of the soap with which it is associated, may be
    dismissed with the words, "Won't Wash!"</p>

    <h2>OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.</h2>

    <p>Why doesn't some publisher bring out <i>The Utterbosh
    Series</i>, for, upon my word, says the Baron, the greater part
    of the books sent in for "notice" are simply beneath it. Here's
    one on which I made notes as I went on, as far as I could get
    through it. It is called <i>Nemesis: a Moral Story</i>, by
    SETON CREWE. Its sole merit would have been its being in one
    volume, were it not that this form, being a bait to the unwary,
    aggravates the offence. The heroine is <i>Lucinda</i>, a
    milliner's apprentice. Being compromised by a young gentleman
    under age, who suddenly quits the country, she goes to confess
    her sin to the simple-minded Curate, who sees no way out of the
    difficulty except by marrying his penitent, which he does, and
    after the christening of her first-born, a joyous event that
    occurs at no great interval after the happy wedding-day, the
    Curate, the <i>Reverend Mr. Smith</i>, is transferred by his
    Bishop from this parish to somewhere else a considerable
    distance off, whence, after a variety of troubles, he goes
    abroad as a travelling watering-place clergyman. After this,

    developes into a thoroughpaced infidel of generally loose
    character. She takes up with a Lion Comique of the Music-Halls,
    who is summarily kicked down-stairs by the <i>Reverend Mr.
    Smith</i> on his return home one evening. And at this point I
    closed the book, not caring one dump what became of any of the
    characters, or of the book, or of the writer, and unable to
    wait for the moral of this highly "moral story," which, I dare
    say, might have done me a great deal of good. So I turned to
    <i>Vanity Fair</i>, and re-read for the hundredth time, and
    with increased pleasure, the great scene where <i>Rawdon
    Crawley</i>, returning home suddenly, surprises <i>Becky</i> in
    her celebrated <i>t&ecirc;te-&agrave;-t&ecirc;te</i> with my
    <i>Lord Steyne</i>.</p>

    <p>With pleasure the Baron welcomes Vol. No. IV. of ROUTLEDGE's
    <i>Carisbrooke Library</i>, which contains certain <i>Early
    Prose Romances</i>, the first and foremost among them being the
    delightful fable of <i>Reynart the Fox</i>. Have patience with
    the old English, refer to the explanatory notes, and its
    perusal will well repay every reader. How came it about that
    modern <i>Uncle Remus</i> had caught so thoroughly the true
    spirit of this Medi&aelig;val romance? I forget, at this
    moment, who wrote <i>Uncle Remus</i>&mdash;and I beg his pardon
    for so doing&mdash;but whoever it was, he professed only to
    dress up and record what he had actually heard from a veritable
    <i>Uncle Remus</i>. <i>Brer Rabbit</i>, <i>Brer Fox</i>, and
    <i>Old Man Bar</i>, are not the creatures of <i>&AElig;sop's
    Fables</i>; they are the characters in <i>Reynart the Fox</i>.
    The tricks, the cunning, the villany of <i>Reynart</i>,
    unredeemed by aught except his affection for his wife and
    family, are thoroughly amusing, and his ultimate success, and
    increased prosperity; present a truer picture of actual life
    than novels in which vice is visibly punished, and virtue
    patiently rewarded. And once more I call to mind the latter
    days of <i>Becky's</i> career.</p>

    <p>Speaking of THACKERAY, Messrs. CASSELL &amp; Co. have just
    brought out a one-and-threepenny edition ("the threepence be
    demmed!") of the <i>Yellowplush Papers</i>, with a dainty
    canary-coloured <i>Jeames</i> on the cover. At the same time
    the same firm produce, in the same form, <i>The Last Days of
    Pompeii</i>, <i>The Last Days of Palmyra</i>, and <i>The Last
    of the Mohicans</i>. Odd, that the first issue of this new
    series should be nearly all "Lasts." <i>The Yellowplush
    Papers</i> might have been kept back, and <i>The Last of the
    Barons</i> been substituted, just to make the set of lasts
    perfect. The expression is suggestive of Messrs. CASSELL going
    in for the shoemaking trade. <i>The Last Days of Palmyra</i> I
    have never read. "I will try it," says the bold Baron.</p>

    <p>But what means this new style of printing on thin double
    sheets? One advantage is that no cutting is required. If this
    form become the fashion, better thus to bring out the
    <i>Utterbosh Series</i>, which shall then escape the critics'
    hands,&mdash;no cutting being required. There are, as those who
    use the paper-knife to these volumes will discover, in this new
    issue of Messrs. CASSELL's, two blank pages for every two
    printed ones, so that a new novel might be written in MS.
    inside the printed one. The paper is good and clean to the
    touch; but I prefer the stiff cover to the limp, "there's more
    backbone about it," says the</p>

    worth while doing it as soon as possible. <i>Advice gratis</i>.

    fits. Nothing better for an invalid than rest for his frame,
    and here are rest and frame in one. Given these (or, if not
    "given," purchased), and a patent indelible-ink-lead pencil
    (whose patent I don't know, as, with much use, the
    gold-lettering is almost obliterated from mine, and all I can
    make out is the word "Eagle"), and the convalescent author may
    do all his work in comfort, without mess or muddle; and hereto,

    <p>Sir,&mdash;I see that you have opened your columns to a
    discussion of the relative advantages of life in London and the
    Suburbs. I don't think that really the two can be compared. If
    you want <i>perfect quietude</i> can you get it better than in
    a place where, between nine and six, not a single male human
    being is visible, all of them being in town? Some people may
    call this dull; but I like it. Then everything is so cheap in
    the Suburbs! I only pay &pound;100 a year for a nice house in a
    street, with a small bath-room, and a garden quite as large as
    a full-sized billiard-table. People tell me I could get the
    same thing in London, but of course a suburban street must be
    nicer than a London one. We are just outside the Metropolitan
    main drainage system, and our death-rate is rather heavy, but
    then our rates are light. My butcher only charges me
    one-and-twopence a pound for best joints, and though this is a
    little dearer than London, the meat is probably more wholesome
    from being in such good air as we enjoy. In wintertime the
    journey to town, half-an-hour by train, has a most bracing
    effect on those capable of bearing severe cold. For the rest,
    the incapables are a real blessing to those who sell
    mustard-plasters and extra-sized pocket-handkerchiefs. Our
    society is so select and refined that I verily believe
    Belgravia can show nothing like it! Yours obediently,</p>

    <p>FAR FROM THE MADDING CROWD.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>Sir,&mdash;The Suburbs are certainly delightful, if you have
    a good train service; but this you seldom get. I do not
    complain of our Company taking three-quarters of an hour to
    perform the distance of eight and a half miles to the City, as
    this seems a good, average suburban rate, but I do think the
    "fast" train (which performs the distance in that time) might
    start a little later than 8.30 A.M. Going in to business at
    10.30 by an "ordinary" train, which stops at sixteen stations,
    and takes an hour and a half, becomes after a time rather
    monotonous. It involves a painful "Rush in Urbe" to get through
    business in time to catch the 4.30 "express" back, a train
    which (theoretically) stops nowhere.</p>

    <p>COUNTRY CUSSIN'.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>Sir,&mdash;No more London for me! I've tried it, and know
    what it's like. I have found a delightful cottage, twenty miles
    from town, and mean to live in it always. Do we ever have one
    of your nasty yellow fogs here? Never! Nothing more than a
    thick white mist, which rises from the fields and envelopes the
    house every night. It is true that several of our family
    complain of rheumatism, and when I had rheumatic fever myself a
    month ago, I found it a little inconvenient being six miles
    from a doctor and a chemist's shop. But then my house is so
    picturesque, with an Early English wooden porch (which can be
    kept from falling to pieces quite easily by hammering a few
    nails in now and then, and re-painting once a week), and no end
    of gables, which only let the water into the bedrooms in case
    of a <i>very</i> heavy shower. Then think of the delights of a
    garden, and a field (for which I pay &pound;20 a year, and
    repair the hedges), and chickens! I don't think I have spent
    more than &pound;50 above what I should have done in London,
    owing to the necessity of fitting up chicken-runs and buying a
    conservatory for my wife, who is passionately fond of flowers.
    Unfortunately my chickens are now moulting, and decline to lay
    again before next March; so I bring back fresh eggs from town,
    and, as my conservatory is not yet full, flowers from Covent
    Garden; and I can assure you that, until you try it, you cannot
    tell the amount of pleasure and exercise which walking a couple
    of miles (the distance of my cottage from the station), laden
    with groceries and other eatables, can be made to afford. Yours
    chirpily,</p>

            and most capacious,</p>

    <h2>ROBERT UP THE RIVER.</h2>

    <p>I atended on a Party larst week as went up the River (our
    nice little Stream, as the aughty Amerrycanes calls it) to Ship
    Lake, tho' why it's called so I coodn't at all make out, as
    there ain't no Ship nor no Lake to be seen there, ony a werry
    little Werry, and a werry littel River, and a werry littel
    Hiland; and it was prinsepally to see how the appy yung Gents
    who sumtimes lives on the same littel Hiland, in littel Tents,
    was a gitting on, as injuced all on us, me and all, to go
    there. It seems that for years parst quite a littel Collony of
    yung Gents as gets their living in the grand old Citty has been
    in the habit of spending their littel summer Hollydays there,
    but, somehows or other, as I coodn't quite understand, the
    master of the littel Hiland made up his mind for to sell it,
    and all the yung Gents was in dispair, and wundered where on
    airth they shood spend their Hollydays in future. But they
    needn't have been afeard&mdash;there was a grand old
    hinstitushun called "The Copperashun!" as had both their ears
    and both their eyes open when they heard about it. So when the
    time came for it to be sold, they jest quietly says to one of
    their principel Chairmen (who is sich a King of Good Fellers
    that they all calls him by that name, and he arnsers to it jest
    as if it was the werry name as was guv him by his Godfathers
    and his Godmothers, as I myself heard with my own ears), "Go
    and buy it!" So off he goes at wunce and buys it, and the
    kindly Copperashun Gents as I went with larst week, went to
    take possesshun on it acordingly, and to see if anythink coud
    be done to make the yung Campers-out ewen more cumferabel than
    they ewer was afore! Ah, that's what I calls trew Pattriotizm,
    and trew Libberality, if you likes, and that's what makes 'em
    so much respeckted.</p>

    <p>Our Gents was all considrably surprized at the lots of Tents
    as was all a standing on Ship Lake Island; one on 'em, who was
    got up quite in a naughtical style, said as he was estonished
    to see so many on 'em pitched, but I think as he must ha' bin
    mistaken, for I didn t see not none on 'em pitched, tho' I
    dessay it might ha' been werry usefool in keeping out the rain
    on a remarkabel wet night.</p>

    <p>By sum mistake on sumboddy's part, there wasn't not no yung
    Campers-out to receeve us, and so fears was hentertaned that
    they wood have to cum again shortly; but they are bold plucky
    gents, is the men of the Copperashun, and they one and all
    xpressed their reddiness to do it at the call of dooty.
    Besides, we had sich a reel Commodore a board as made us all
    quite reddy to brave the foaming waves again. Why, he guv out
    the word of command, whether it was to "Port the Helem," or to
    "Titen the mane braces," as if he had bin a Hadmiral at the
    werry least, and his galliant crew obeyed him without not no
    grumbling or ewen thretening to strike!</p>

    <p>By one of them striking and remarkabel ocurrences as happens
    so offen, who shood we appen to find at Ship Lake, but one of
    the werry poplarest of the Court of Haldermen, and what shood
    he do but ask 'em all in to lunch at his splendid manshun, and
    what shood they all do but jump at the hoffer, and what does he
    do, for a lark, I serppose&mdash;if so be as a reel Poplar
    Alderman ewer does have sich a thing as a lark&mdash;and give
    'em all sich a gloryous spread, as I owerheard one henergetick
    Deperty describe it, as hutterly deprived 'em all of the power
    of heating a bit of dinner till the werry next day, to which
    time they wisely put it off, and then thorowly injoyed it.</p>

    <p>In course, I'm not allowed to menshun not no names on these
    conferdential ocasions, but I did hear "the Commodore" shout to
    "the King" sumthink about "Hansum is as Hansum does," but it
    was rayther too late in the heavening for me to be able to
    quite unnerstand his elusions.</p>

    <p>I am 'appy to be able to report that we every one on us
    arrived in Town quite safe and quite happy, xcep sum of the
    pore hard-working crew who are left at Marlow till further
    orders. ROBERT.</p>

    <h2>A SPORTING STYLE.</h2>

    <h4>(<i>Third Example.</i>)</h4>

    <p>Two examples of a correct sporting style have been already
    laid before the public. For convenience of reference they may
    be defined as the mixed-pugilistic and the insolent. There is,
    however, a third variety, the equine, in which everyone who
    aspires to wield the pen of a sporting reporter must
    necessarily be a proficient. It may be well to warn a beginner
    that he must not attempt this style until he has laid in a
    large stock of variegated metaphoric expressions. As a matter
    of fact one horse-race is very much like another in its main
    incidents, and the process of betting against or in favour of
    one horse resembles, more or less, the process of betting about
    any other. The point is, however, to impart to monotonous
    incidents a variety they do not possess; and to do this
    properly a luxuriant vocabulary is essential. For instance, in
    the course of a race, some horses tire, or, to put it less
    offensively, go less rapidly than others. The reporter will say
    of such a horse that he (1) "shot his bolt," or (2) "cried
    <i>peccavi</i>," or (3) "cried a go," or (4) "compounded," or
    (5) "exhibited signals of distress," or (6) "fired minute
    guns," or (7) "fell back to mend his bellows," or (8) "seemed
    to pause for reflection."</p>

    <div class="figleft"
         style="width:10%;">
        <a href="images/143-2.png"><img width="100%"
             src="images/143-2.png"
             alt="" /></a>
    </div>

    <p>Again, in recording the upward progress of horses in the
    betting market, it would be ridiculous to say of all of them
    merely that they became hot favourites. Vary, therefore,
    occasionally, by saying of one, for example, that "here was
    another case of one being eventually served up warm"; of
    another, that "plenty of the talent took 7 to 4 about
    <i>Mousetrap</i>;" of a third, that "<i>Paradox</i> had the
    call at 4 to 1;" and of a fourth, that "a heap of money, and
    good money too, went on <i>Backslide</i>." After these
    preliminary instructions, <i>Mr. Punch</i> offers his</p>

    <p><i>Third Example</i>.&mdash;Event to be described: A
    horse-race. Names of horses and jockeys, weights, &amp;c.,
    supplied.</p>

    <p>Considerable delay took place. <i>Little Benjy</i> made a
    complete hole in his manners by bolting. Eventually, however,
    the flag tell to a capital start. <i>Burglar Bill</i> on the
    right cut out the work<a id="footnotetag1"
       name="footnotetag1"></a><a href="#footnote1"><sup>1</sup></a>
       from <i>Paladin</i>, who soon began to blow great guns, and
       after a quarter of a mile had been negotiated yielded his
       pride of place to <i>Cudlums</i> with <i>The P'liceman</i>
       in attendance, <i>Sobriety</i> lying fourth, and <i>D.
       T.</i> close behind. Thus they raced to the bend, where
       <i>Burglar Bill</i> cried <i>peccavi</i>, and <i>Cudlums</i>
       having shot her bolt, <i>Sobriety</i> was left in front,
       only to be challenged by <i>Cropeared Sue</i>, who had been
       coming through her horses with a wet sail. Bounding the bend
       SIMPSON called upon <i>Mrs. Brady</i> and literally took tea
       with her rivals,<a id="footnotetag2"
       name="footnotetag2"></a><a href="#footnote2"><sup>2</sup></a>
       whom he nailed to the counter one after another. The
       favourite compounded at the distance, and <i>Mrs. Brady</i>
       romped home the easiest of winners, four lengths ahead of
       <i>Cropeared Sue</i>; a bad third. The rest were whipped in
       by <i>Flyaway</i>, who once more failed to justify the
       appellation bestowed upon him.</p>

    <p><i>Mr. Punch</i> flatters himself that, upon the above
    model, the report of any race-meeting could be accurately
    constructed at home. In future, therefore, no reporter should
    go to the expense of leaving London for Epsom, Newmarket,
    Ascot, or Goodwood.</p>

        <p>At first sight it would appear more natural that SIMPSON
        (presumably a jockey) having called upon <i>Mrs. Brady</i>,
        should take tea with <i>her</i> rather than with her
        rivals. But a sporting style involves us in puzzles.</p>

    <h2>INTERVIEWING &Agrave; LA MODE.</h2>

    <h4>(<i>Quite at the Service of some of Mr. Punch's
    Contemporaries.</i>)</h4>

    <p>One of our Representatives called a few days since upon Mr.
    BROWN, senior member of the well-known firm of Messrs. BROWN,
    JONES, AND ROBINSON. The Eminent General Dealer was seated "in
    his counting-house," as the nursery-song hath it, "counting out
    his money."</p>

    <p>"Come in, come in!" said Mr. BROWN, cordially, as he
    somewhat hurriedly looked up the coin in a safe out of our
    reach. "I am delighted to see you."</p>

    <p>"Glad to hear it," we replied, rather drily. "We want to put
    a few questions to you, in the interest of the public."</p>

    <p>"As many as you please. I am, as you know, a man of
    business; still, the resources of our establishment are so
    vast, that my place can be supplied without inconvenience to
    our thousands, I may say millions of customers. And now, Sir,
    what can I do for you?"</p>

    <p>"Well, Mr. BROWN, speaking in the name of civilisation, I
    would wish to ask you if you have much sale for SMASHUP's
    Concentrated Essence of Cucumbers (registered), in the larger
    bottles?"</p>

    <p>"Yes, Sir, we have; although the smaller sizes are,
    possibly, a trifle more popular."</p>

    <p>"What do you think of COTTONBACK's Fleur de Lyons Putney
    Satin?"</p>

    <p>"A most admirable material for home wear, although we do not
    recommend it for use at a party, a ball, or a reception. For
    festive occasions we do a very large trade in GIGGLEWATER's
    Superfine Velvet South American <i>Moir&eacute; Antique</i> as
    advertised."</p>

    <p>"Indeed! Perhaps, you can mention a few more articles that
    in your judgment you believe it will interest our readers to
    learn about."</p>

    <p>"Pardon me, but don't you put that sentence a trifle
    clumsily?"</p>

    <p>Our Representative smiled and blushed. Then he admitted that
    Mr. BROWN might be right.</p>

    <p>"Ha! ha! ha!" laughed the Senior Partner, in great glee.
    "You see I have my head screwed on the right way! But to answer
    you. GOTEMON's Patent Alligator's Skin Braces are attracting
    much attention just now, so is WIPE's Castle 2 Imperial William
    Champagne, which finds (I may observe confidentially) a ready
    sale at thirty-two shillings the dozen. Then there are AKE's
    Electric Tooth-brushes, and CRAX's Stained-glass Solid Mahogany
    Brass-mounted Elizabethan Mantel-boards. Then, of course, I
    must not forget BOLTER's Washhandstands and BOUNDER's
    Anti-agony Aromatic Pills."</p>

    <p>"And all these articles sell largely?"</p>

    <p>"Very largely, indeed. And so they should; for they are well
    worth the money they cost."</p>

    <p>"Indeed they are, or I should not find them in your
    establishment."</p>

    <p>"You are very good. And now, <i>&agrave; propos</i> of your
    journal, will you permit me to pay a return compliment?"</p>

    <p>"Certainly," we replied. "You have noticed an improvement in
    our columns?"</p>

    <p>"Unquestionably I have," returned Mr. BROWN, emphatically.
    "I have observed that of late you have given much interesting
    matter in the body of your paper that heretofore used to be
    reserved for the pages exclusively devoted to advertisements. I
    congratulate you!"</p>

    <p>And with a courteous wave of his hand and a bow of
    dismissal, the Eminent Pillar of Commerce delicately intimated
    to us that our interview was at an end.</p>

one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to

such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.

terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"

Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the

from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the

     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax

     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days

both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Each eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook's
eBook number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII,
compressed (zipped), HTML and others.

Corrected EDITIONS of our eBooks replace the old file and take over
the old filename and etext number.  The replaced older file is renamed.
VERSIONS based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving
new filenames and etext numbers.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

EBooks posted prior to November 2003, with eBook numbers BELOW #10000,
are filed in directories based on their release date.  If you want to
download any of these eBooks directly, rather than using the regular
search system you may utilize the following addresses and just
download by the etext year.

     http://www.gutenberg.net/etext06

    (Or /etext 05, 04, 03, 02, 01, 00, 99,
     98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90)

EBooks posted since November 2003, with etext numbers OVER #10000, are
filed in a different way.  The year of a release date is no longer part
of the directory path.  The path is based on the etext number (which is
identical to the filename).  The path to the file is made up of single
digits corresponding to all but the last digit in the filename.  For
example an eBook of filename 10234 would be found at:

     http://www.gutenberg.net/1/0/2/3/10234

or filename 24689 would be found at:
     http://www.gutenberg.net/2/4/6/8/24689
